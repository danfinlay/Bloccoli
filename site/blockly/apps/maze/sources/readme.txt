This directory contains sources for the images used in the Maze app.  These
files are not required to run the maze, but they are required if one wants
to modify the graphics.

Pegman:
* tiles_pegman.xcf -- A Gimp file containing layers for the road, buildings,
their shadows, and a grid.

Astronaut:
* space_station.pov -- A POV-Ray 3.6 file that renders 3D sprites for the
space station modules.  Runs as an animation where 'clock' starts at 1 and
increments to 15.
* tiles_astro.xcf -- A Gimp file containing all the 3D sprites as layers.
This graphic needs to be brightend, shrunk, and sharpened for use.

Panda:
* bamboo.xcf -- A Gimp file containing the slices needed to create all 15
permutations of the bamboo road.  Original graphics created with:
